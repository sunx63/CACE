# CACE
The method is to estimate the CACE of a multisite randomized trial with binary outcomes and incomplete compliances by fitting a random coefficient model and estimating via ML approach.

The scripts are functioalized. There are three desmonstration scripts uploaded to the repository. Script r1_q4_n40_x1x2_potential.R is for simulating a dataset of a multisite study with cluster size of 40 and 170 sites, and both potential outcomes and complete compliances, and estimating the average treatment effect by lme4 package. This is to show the gold standard of estimating treatment effect with potential outcomes. The simulation function in the script can generate a dataset with potential or observed outcomes as shown in comments (L2 is for a dataset with potential outcomes and L1o is a set with observed outcomes). Script r1_q4_n80_J65_x1x2_my05.R is for simulating a dataset of a multisite study with cluster size of 80, 65 sites and 5% missing rate in outcomes, and estimating the average treatment effect with our method with one random effect sharing. Script r3_q4_n40_J170_x1x2_my0.R is for simulating a dataset of a multisite study with cluster size of 40, 170 sites and outcomes completely observed, and estimating the average treatment effect with our method with no random effect sharing. 

Users need to download all functional scripts and run modify any main script accordingly. The function in script cace_1side_parallel_lambda.R is the major function for CACE estimation with random effect sharing. The function in script cace_1side_parallel.R is the major function for CACE estimation without random effect sharing. The function in script set_init.R is for generating the initial values of all parameters when there is a random effect(s) sharing (r=1 or 2), while the function in script set_init_noshare.R for generating the initial values of all parameters when there is no random effect sharing (r=3). The functions in the rest scripts can be used with or without random effect sharing (r=1, 2 or 3).
